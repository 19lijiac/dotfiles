# Simple configuration files management

This repository is inspired by other "dotfiles" repos, particularly [this one by @kalkayan](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles).  It does _not_ contain any top-level non-hidden files like README.md or LICENSE to ensure that it can be cloned as a bare repo in your home directory to track all your desired config, without cluttering your home directory with extraneous files.
